      content="I am Senior Software Engineer 
      With over 7 years of experience in building and deploying complex web applications using a variety of technologies.
      I love doing end-to-end product development work in close collaboration with product management and designers — all the way from product idea, initial strategy, sprints management and development.
      I have worked with early-stage startup companies around the world, helping them in building their products and working closely on setting up business models, assisting and supporting them along the way in securing Investments. 
      I am specialized in working with programming languages like JavaScript and Typescript. I am experienced in working with many front-end and back-end technologies like React, Node, NextJs, NestJs and Databases like No-SQL MongoDB, PostgreSQL Relational Database.
      Furthermore, I have deep experience with project management. I used management tools like Linear/Trello/Jira for creating and managing the sprint tickets. So not only as a developer but also as a product engineer. 
      I am looking forward to being the best resource for your organization.
